Hi, I'm Matteo. I am a first year PhD student in the Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) department at UC Berkeley, where I study optimization algorithms and stochastic processes. More broadly, my research interests include reinforcement learning, optimal decision-making, and multi-agent systems. 

In the little free time I find, I love contributing to open-source software -- primarily in Rust and Python. Give me a follow on GitHub!
