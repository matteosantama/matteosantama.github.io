Hi, I'm Matteo. I am a first year PhD student in the Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) department at UC Berkeley, where I study optimization algorithms and stochastic processes. More broadly, my research interests include reinforcement learning, optimal decision-making, and multi-agent systems. In the little free time I find, I love contributing to open-source software -- primarily in Rust and Python. You can find some recent projects of mine on GitHub.

Feel free to connect with me at **matteosantamaria+blog [at] berkeley [dot] edu** -- I am always eager to engage with interesting people and innovative ideas!
